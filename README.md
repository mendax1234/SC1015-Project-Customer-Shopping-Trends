# ❤️ Topic: Customer Shopping Trends

## Overview:
This repo contains the project files for the SC1015 mini-project from FCSF Group 6. \
In the rapidly evolving retail landscape, businesses face significant challenges in meeting the diverse preferences of consumers. Additionally, without accurate predictions of product ratings, sellers may miss critical insights into consumer feedback that could drive improvements. \
We use data science and machine learning to enhance the shopping experience by personalising product recommendations for shoppers and predicting product ratings for sellers. \
Listed here are the ipynb files used, which should be view in numerical order.

## Dataset:
The dataset that we have chosen is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset/data) and contains data of customer shopping trends.

## Methodology:
### [Data Extraction and Visualisation](./Data-Extraction-and-Analysis.ipynb)

The dataset includes a combination of numerical values and categorical values.

- **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Handle invalid and NaN values
    - Handle duplicate values
    - Check the data type consistency
    - Check the label consistency and correctness

- **Data Visualisation**:
    - Do uni-variate and multivariate analysis on numerical data.
    - Use bar chart and heatmap to visualise Item Purchased against different categorical data. We get some useful information like seasonal purchasing trend and regional purchasing trend.
    - Use boxplots to visualise the Review Rate against different categorical data. But m
